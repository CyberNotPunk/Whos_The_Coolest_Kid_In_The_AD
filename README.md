<h1>☢️ Who's The Coolest User From Your AD ? ☢️</h1>
</br>
<p>Are you done tired of manually looking and adding groups to new workers at your company in your AD ? Well, I did, and don't want you to live the same. Here's a script to choose an user, list the groups of which he's a member (lucky him) and copy/paste them to a new user through the GUI (how wonderful).</p>
</br>
<h2>⚠️  How To ?</h2>
</br>
<p>Just download the file, launch it from your AD with admin privileges (trust me u won't regret it) and enjoy your free time (I won't be responsible for any trauma caused by your lack of self-confidence regarding the number of groups your users have and u don't, looser).</p>
